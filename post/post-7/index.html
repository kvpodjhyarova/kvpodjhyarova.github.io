Popular with universities, governments and financial institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Fields of application:</strong> financial analysis, mathematical research, scientific computing.</p>
<h2 id="kotlin">Kotlin</h2>
<p>Designed to interact with Java, Kotlin is packed with functional programming and OOP features, including lambda expressions, operator overloading, and so on. In 2019, Google named Kotlin as the language of choice for Android development, so it&rsquo;s definitely worth learning for those who plan to build Android apps and plugins for popular SDKs.</p>
<p><strong>Applicable areas:</strong> Android applications, server-side development, and all areas where Java is used.</p>
<h2 id="lisp">Lisp</h2>
<p>Lisp is a group of languages ​​related to the historical implementation of LISP, which was developed at MIT in the 1950s to describe programs in a mathematical way. The syntax in Lisp is based on s-expressions, which distinguishes it from most other languages, many of which are related to or influenced by C. Lisp was popular in early AI research and was widely used as a scripting language for CAD and other engineering applications because it treats code as data and allows language customization via macros, which distinguishes it from more static languages. Notable applications based on it include AutoLisp (a script for AutoCad) and Roomba. One of the languages ​​in the family, Clojure, is especially useful for building large scale business and web applications.</p>
<p><strong>Fields of application:</strong> artificial intelligence, robotics, scripting, language extensions, research, development.</p>
<p>##lua</p>
<p>Lua was developed in 1993 by Roberto Jeruzalimski for embedding in other applications. It is now widely used as a scripting language for adding new features to programs. For example, it can be used to supplement the description of game logic in the development of video games or expand the set of user functions in graphic applications.</p>
<p><strong>Fields of application:</strong> software extensions, game logic, automation, electronics / internet of things.</p>
<h2 id="powershell">PowerShell</h2>

<h2 id="r">R</h2>
<p>R was released in 1995 for statistical calculations and other complex mathematical operations related to data analysis and graphics. The Fortune 500 often uses R to perform complex risk analysis, customer trends, and other computationally intensive tasks. R is different from many statistics languages, and its s-expression-based syntax is reminiscent of Lisp. Although rarely used for other purposes, R is considered the standard in data analytics, especially for market forecasting or user trend analysis.</p>
<p>Applications: data mining, predictive analytics, graphics.</p>
<h2 id="ruby">Ruby</h2>
<p>Ruby was developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto in 1995 as an object-oriented scripting language to make up for the lack of OOP features in other scripting programming languages ​​of the time. Features such as dynamic typing, inheritance, reflection, and operator overloading make it ideal for creating complex scripts and web server applications.</p>
<p>Applications: complex scripts, package management, utilities, web servers.</p>
<h2 id="rust">Rust</h2>
<p>Rust is a multi-paradigm language designed for building large-scale parallel systems with high performance and reliability. Since 2016, Rust has been voted the most popular programming language in a StackOverflow poll every year. Being a system-level language similar to C++ and not requiring long processing times or having a virtual machine, Rust provides low-level access to hardware. This makes it ideal for developing operating systems, programs for microcontrollers and other software where hardware performance is critical.</p>
<p>Applications: OS development, embedded applications, servers, tools, games.</p>
<h2 id="sql">SQL</h2>
<p>SQL is a general purpose programming language but is a powerful domain-specific language for managing relational databases. Its applications, from Fortune 500 data warehouses to embedded SQLite, are widely used in desktop and mobile applications. Many positions in IT and development require at least a basic knowledge of SQL. Advanced skills allow the developer to create extremely secure and robust domain rules that are independent of the programming language or SDK used. High profile implementations include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and PostgreSQL. Each of them has a unique extension of the SQL language and offers new features that go beyond the core SQL specification. Learning SQL does not take much time and will come in handy in many areas from analytics and data processing to IT management and software development.</p>
<p>Applications: working with relational data, embedding data in applications.</p>
<h2 id="swift">Swift</h2>
<p>Swift was released by Apple in 2014 as a replacement for Objective-C in their products (similar to how Kotlin replaced Java for Android). Swift retains some of the Objective-C features (such as dynamic dispatch) used in Apple product software, but features increased security and a modified syntax closer to C# or Java.</p>
<p>Applications: creating applications for macOS, iOS, watchOS and so on.</p>
<h2 id="typescript">Typescript</h2>
<p>TypeScript is an open source language from Microsoft designed to add OOP functionality to JavaScript and improve the usability of complex applications. TypeScript, introduced in 2012, is commonly used to build robust, scalable web apps, frameworks, and other programs, such as the popular VS Code editor.</p>
<p>Applications: web interface, API development, games, scaling any JavaScript software.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>For a successful career in IT, you need to know at least several languages ​​from this list. Each of them has its own strengths and weaknesses: it is best to take advantage of a particular environment and look for other tools for those areas where the system does not perform as well. If a language is not suitable for a particular task, find one that is more useful. There are many programming styles and dozens of design patterns for each of these languages.</p>
