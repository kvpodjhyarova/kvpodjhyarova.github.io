This idea is directly present in the name of the holiday.\nAll children’s rights and freedoms are reflected in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1959. It proclaims the equal rights of children in the field of upbringing, education, social security, physical and spiritual development, regardless of skin color, nationality, social origin, property status, etc. The Declaration calls on parents, public organizations, governments to recognize the rights of children and promote their implementation.\nHistory is silent why it was decided to celebrate this children’s holiday on June 1. According to one version, in 1925, the Consul General of China in San Francisco gathered a group of Chinese orphans and arranged for them to celebrate the Duan Wu Ze (Dragon Boat Festival), the date of which just fell on June 1. Luckily, this day coincided with the time of the “children’s” conference in Geneva.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, when the problems of preserving the health and well-being of children were more urgent than ever, in 1949 a congress of women was held in Paris, at which an oath was voiced to fight for a lasting peace, as the only guarantee for the happiness of children. And in the same year, at the Moscow session of the Council of the International Democratic Women’s Federation, in accordance with the decisions of its 2nd Congress, today’s holiday was established. And a year later, in 1950, on June 1, the first International Children’s Day was held, after which this holiday is held annually.\n","date":1654128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654128000,"objectID":"d547d37197f3f9ad69390dab92b14398","permalink":"https://example.com/post/post-9/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post-9/","section":"post","summary":"International Children's Day is celebrated annually in more than 30 countries and is one of the oldest international holidays.","tags":["Academic","开源"],"title":"June 1 - International Children's Day","type":"post"},{"authors":["Podyarova Kseniya","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo",""],"content":"May 19-25 Thursday May 26th\nThursday 12 May started with a class in my favorite subject “Calculation” at 9:00 am.

Bash, an updated Unix shell, was first released in the late 80s and is still under active development. Bash is typically scripted for server configuration, so it’s a good choice for modern cloud environments with containerized storage and microservices. Shell scripts are used quite often, so knowledge of this language is useful.\nAlso worth noting is zsh, which is currently the default shell on macOS.\nApplicable areas: server administration, CLI tools, DevOps, virtualization.\nCOBOL One of the oldest languages ​​still in use today was created by Grace Hopper in the late 1950s and was intended to standardize the development of large-scale business applications on computers. A brilliant concept that is still used today in cross-platform SDKs. An incredible 95% of ATM transactions go through COBOL systems, with many of these devices operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Device vendors such as IBM develop more powerful COBOL machines but continue to maintain and upgrade existing systems due to the cost and risk of replacing them. COBOL isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. This is a good choice for those who want to work with clients from the financial sector.\nFields of application: banking/finance, international corporations, governments.\nC/C++ These languages ​​often occupy the top of various ratings - they are valued for their power and speed. C was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C++ was developed by Bjorn Stroustrup in 1985. Today, these two languages ​​underpin everything from operating systems and games to modern scientific computing and machine learning. C and C++ are well suited for demanding applications that value low-level hardware access and performance. Learning these languages ​​takes time and effort.\nScope: OS / SDK development, embedded devices, game engines, science.\nC# C#, released by Microsoft in 2000, was developed by Anders Hejlsberg as a cross-platform object-oriented programming language. It is now often used to develop business applications, APIs, games, and more. Due to its wide feature set, this language is suitable for graphics and other asynchronous programming tasks.\nFields of application: corporate applications, software and user interface development, games, graphics.\nDart A modern language developed by Google for building mobile, desktop, web and server applications. Its creator Lars Bak also came up with the JavaSript Engine V8. Dart resembles other modern object-oriented programming languages—C#, TypeScript, and Java—and provides a rich set of features suitable for defining complex interactions, asynchronous operations, animation, and other tasks.\nApplication areas: cross-platform applications, cloud services / enterprise systems, games, graphics.\nFortran Fortran, developed at IBM in the 1950s by John Backus, is a general-purpose language that was created for scientific and engineering work. It is still widely used for these purposes, including benchmark testing of the world’s fastest supercomputers. It has also been applied in space and physics research and weather modeling.\nApplications: aerospace/defense, scientific computing, numerical analysis.\nJava Java is a general-purpose OOP language developed in the 1990s by James Gosling at Sun (now owned by Oracle) and designed to be compiled into bytecode to run on the Java virtual machine. By 2020, this includes almost every kind of device, from TVs and game consoles to servers, phones and even kitchen appliances. The language is widely used in corporations and universities, which has made it popular among both novice programmers and experienced developers.\nApplicable areas: enterprise applications, embedded systems, web services, games.\n##JavaScript\nJavaScript was developed by Brandon Eich in the 1990s to add scripting to websites. Today it is a universal web interface language with powerful, standardized features that are supported by all major browsers. JavaScript conforms to the EcmaScript standard, which is updated every few years with new language specifications. In addition, JavaScript is often used to develop back-end services and APIs, mobile applications, games, and other software. This is an excellent choice for learning and further improvement.\nFields of application: full-stack development, cloud services / container storage, games, utilities.\nJulia A modern high-level language designed for high-performance numerical processing and statistical analysis. Julia was developed in 2009 by Jeff Besanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah and Alan Edelman. It is one of four languages ​​that can achieve petaflops of supercomputing performance (along with C, C++, and Fortran). Popular with universities, governments and financial institutions.\nFields of application: financial analysis, mathematical research, scientific computing.\nKotlin Designed to interact with Java, Kotlin is packed with …","date":1653523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653523200,"objectID":"c6da4f15cac07e28e10df4fae642591b","permalink":"https://example.com/post/post-7/","publishdate":"2022-05-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post-7/","section":"post","summary":"Today there are hundreds of programming languages in the world - how to choose the most suitable one for learning among them?

When preparing a report on laboratory work, you will master a number of important elements that will later be useful to you when writing term papers and dissertations. Report structure According to GOST 7.32-2001, any research work must be contain the following elements:\n  title page;\n  essay;\n  introduction;\n  the main part;\n  conclusion.\n  GOST also recommends that the following elements be included in the work:\n  list of performers;\n  content;\n  Normative references;\n  definitions;\n  designations and abbreviations;\n  list of sources used;\n  applications.\n  If you are carrying out complex work that is carried out in several stages, then you may you need to include part or all of the elements of the second list.\nContents of the main elements of the report**   Title page. The first sheet of work is drawn up strictly according to the model, which is usually given in teaching aids for your subject. It not only requires specifying such elements as the name of the educational institution, type of work and information about the performer, but also arrange them in strict accordance with the standards.\n  Abstract. The abstract is actually a summary of your entire report and contains a number of statistical information. It must indicate the number of parts, pages of work, illustrations, applications, tables, used literary sources and applications. Here is a list of key words of the work and the actual text of the abstract. The latter implies the main elements of the work from the set goals to the results and recommendations for their implementation. In the practice of universities, the abstract is usually not included in the reports on laboratory work.\n  Introduction. In the introduction of a typical laboratory work, the goals of the ongoing research and tasks, the implementation of which will help achieve the goals, are usually prescribed. At the same time, there are works in which students become real pioneers. Have you ever experienced a feeling of extreme curiosity and impatience while doing lab work? Feel that in just a couple of minutes you will find the answer to a question that no one has ever found an answer to? It is for such studies that a detailed introduction is written with proof of the relevance and novelty of the topic under study. In order to really conduct research in an area in which, as they say, no human foot has yet set foot, in the introduction you will need to assess the current state of the problem under consideration and justify the need to solve it.\n  Main part. Since different universities and disciplines have their own subtleties of laboratory work, the content of the main part is described in detail in the relevant manuals. It is important that this section of the work reflects its essence, describes the methodology and results of the work done.\n  The main part contains the following elements:\n  the purpose of the study;\n  tasks, the implementation of which will help achieve the goals;\n  a workflow that describes the actions performed;\n  other sections provided for by the methodological materials on the studied discipline.\n  Conclusion. In this part of the work, you will need to draw conclusions based on the results obtained during the laboratory work. To do this, evaluate how well the tasks have been completed. Complex works may contain other elements, for example, recommendations for further application of the results of the work carried out.

The main thing\nOne of the most famous ski resorts in Russia is located at the meeting point of the Altai Mountains with the Sayan Mountains, in Mountain Shoria. For the beauty of the relief, it is often called the Siberian Switzerland. It has everything for relaxation - from dog sledding to helicopter rides, from spa services to nightclubs. In summer, Mountain Shoria is ideal for mountain walks and excursions to caves.\n2. Story\nThe name of the region came from the indigenous people, the Shors. Mountain Shoria is a region famous for iron ore deposits. Since the 19th century, iron has been mined here, as well as wood, pine nuts and fur-bearing animals. In Soviet times, the region was infamous for the huge number of Gulag institutions.\nThe ski resort was built in Sheregesh in 1981 for the Spartakiad of the peoples of the RSFSR, but it received the most active development only in 2000.\n3. Impression\nThe phenomenon of Sheregesh is skiers in swimsuits. Winters in Sheregesh, although sunny, are frosty. In April, the temperature rises to + 10-15 degrees, the bright sun warms skiers, ski jackets quickly change into swimsuits.\nIn general, the resort is extremely atmospheric. Before the advent of Krasnaya Polyana, it was the most visited in Russia, and not only Siberians came here, but also residents of central Russia. Many are in love with its homely atmosphere and the hospitality of the locals and return year after year, affectionately calling Geshem.\nInformation  👉 Link to the implementation of the 1st stage of an individual project on Youtube 📚 My website 💬 [Vkontakte] (https://vk.com/ksupod)  ❤️ Click here to become a sponsor ❤️ ","date":1651708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651708800,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Good afternoon!

The version control system allows you to store multiple versions of the same document, revert to earlier versions if necessary, determine who made a change and when, and much more. Such systems are most widely used in software development to store the source codes of the program being developed.\nGIT is one such system. GIT uses a distributed model instead of the traditional client-server model. Thus, GIT repositories do not need a centralized repository: the entire history of document changes is stored on each computer, in local storage, and, if necessary, individual fragments of the local storage history are synchronized with the same storage on another computer.\nToday, GIT has become the standard version control system for so many developers, and GitHub source code hosting is the largest such service. Examples of projects using Git are the Linux kernel, Android, Ruby on Rails, Drupal, Wine, Chromium, Compiz Fusion, jQuery, PHP, MediaWiki, and some Linux distributions\nInformation  👉 Link to the implementation of the 1st stage of an individual project on Youtube 📚 My website 💬 [Vkontakte] (https://vk.com/ksupod)  Thank you all for your attention!

Indifference and unwillingness to bear responsibility for anything in principle is a disease of modern society. The school continues to develop a responsible attitude of students to nature, observance of the moral and legal principles of nature management, and also activates civic consciousness.\nIn accordance with Article 24 of Federal Law No. 261, starting from January 1, 2010, the school is obliged to reduce, under comparable conditions, the volume of consumed water, diesel and other fuels, fuel oil, natural gas, thermal, electric energy, coal within five years by at least 15 % of the volume actually consumed by it in 2009 of each of the indicated resources with an annual decrease in such volume by at least 3%. Working on the problem of energy saving, we thought about reducing the amount of energy consumed, and also learn how to solve the problem of energy saving. I have monitored the school where I study on the basis of the “Declaration for 2015 of the institution “MBOU “Kurumkan Secondary School No. 1\u0026#34;” Information on the consumption of energy resources in the building, structure, structure / Educational building /”\nIn 2015, Kurumkan Secondary School No. 1 spent:\n  Thermal energy - 1253 Gkl. for a total amount of 5647 million rubles.\n  Electricity - 56838 kW. for a total amount of 335344 rubles.\n  The school has 338 pcs. incandescent lamps, which is 74% of the total mass of all lamps in the school. Also, the school has outdated kitchen equipment, which incurs additional energy costs, because cooking requires additional heating of the stove. There is no roof insulation, but there is an insulated basement. And our school is on a reduced class of energy and environmental efficiency of the building E= 37.121.\nThe reasons for the current situation in the school were identified:\n  In 2015, energy saving programs were not implemented.\n  According to modern standards, the illumination of some rooms, utility rooms and other objects does not meet; the wiring is old, not all incandescent lamps have been replaced with fluorescent ones.\n  The duration of electricity consumption for lighting is 9 hours a day;\n  Introduction of information technologies into the learning process (the number of computers -2 has increased, which also increased the consumption of the electric field. To solve this problem, it is planned to replace incandescent lamps with energy-saving lighting sources.)\n  SHIFT ITEMS\nRequested funds:\n  Energy-saving lamps - 338 pcs.\n  Replacement of lamps with motion sensors - 32 pcs.\n  Replacing old kitchen stoves with induction stoves - 4 pcs.\n  HOW TO SAVE ENERGY:   Insulation of attics and basements (repair of thermal insulation of heating systems).\n  Insulation of facades, entrance doors and windows (or their replacement).\n  Transfer of heating to standby mode during off-hours.\n  Carry out timely scheduled checks of metering devices; in case of failure and malfunctions, do not allow the presentation of invoices for installed capacity;\n  Monitor the operation of accounting and regulation systems,\n  Monitor the proper operation of refrigeration equipment;\n  Carry out timely replacement and repair of faulty taps, plumbing, process equipment\n  Conduct briefings on controlling the consumption of electricity, cold water, computer and other equipment.\n  To control the consumption of electricity, the correct operation of electrical appliances;\n  Ensure compliance with the schedule of light regime in the premises and on the territory.\n  Replace incandescent lamps with fluorescent lamps, which are 60-80% more energy efficient than incandescent lamps. Their service life is on the order of 6,000 to 20,000 hours versus 1,000 hours for an incandescent lamp.\n  Replace incandescent lamps in the basement, utility part with motion sensors.\n  Replace conventional electric hotplates with induction hobs. They cook food by creating an electromagnetic field that only heats the bottom of the cookware. As a result, there is no energy loss.\n  Organize the participation of parents in the implementation of socially significant energy saving projects.\n  Disseminate information about the results of the project on the school website.\n  Campaign work should be carried out at the school (physics lessons, holding a decade in physics “Ecology and Physics”, information stands on energy saving at school, class hours on the topic of energy saving). Carrying out an advertising campaign to disseminate information:\n  Competition of posters, leaflets, wall newspapers. Posted throughout the school to give children the opportunity to critically reflect on the information provided and reflect on …","date":1608854400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608854400,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://example.com/project/example/","publishdate":"2020-12-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"A project that talks about energy losses and how to eliminate them.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Project \"Energy Efficient School\"","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
